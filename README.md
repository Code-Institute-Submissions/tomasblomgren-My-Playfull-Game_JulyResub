# My version of the famous card game Blackjack. 
## Rules
The game is played out in the following way. You have a dealer which gives you cards(the house/dealer). The value of the cards are following: all numbered cards have their value displayed as normal(1 = 1 and so on). The suited cards (Jacks Queens and Kings) have the amount 10 and the Ace have either 11 or 1. The goal of the game is to get higher than the valued cards than the house. The highest valued hand is Blackjack with the value of 21. However if you get a higher hand than 22 you "bust" meaning you lose the hand. 

 At 16 or below you must draw a new card. 

If you get a hand between 17 and 21 you can stay

If you have an ace on hand it can be counted as 1 instead of 11.


If the house has a hand with the same value as you the house wins the round


Enjoy!
